Assignment 1.07: Parsing Monsters
Thomas Powell

This file will print a dungeon with monsters. Move with the 1-9 keys or
    the vim keys. Use q to quit. Use m to open the monster list with up and down arrow
    keys to scroll; ESC to exit. The monster list shows the locations relative to the player. 
    Use 'f' to toggle "fog of war". Use 't' to initiate teleport, then 'r' to teleport randomly 
    or 't' again to teleport '*'. Monsters will not be rendered unless in sight of the player.
    
Use "make rlg327" to compile executable dungeon.

Use "./rlg327" to generate a random dungeon.

Use "./rlg327 --save" to save dungeon to /home/"insert_username_here"/.rlg327/dungeon   (-s)

Use "./rlg327 --load" to load dungeon from same location.                               (-l)

Use "./rlg327 --nummon x" to generate a dungeon with 'x' amount of monsters             (-n)

Use "./rlg327 --parse x" to print the parsed monsters or objects. Where 'x' is '0'(monsters) or '1'(objects). (-p)

Use "make clean" to delete the generated files.
