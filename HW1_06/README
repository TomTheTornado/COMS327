Assignment 1.06: Fog of War and Converting to C++
Thomas Powell

This file will print a dungeon with monsters. One can move with the 1-9 keys or
    the vim keys. Use q to quit. Use m to open the monster list, up and down arrow
    keys to scroll through the list. Use the ESC key to exit the monster list.
    The monster list shows the locations relative to the player. Use 'f' to toggle
    "fog of war" on and off. Use 't' to initiate teleport, then 'r' to teleport randomly or 't'
    again to teleport to the location marked with the '*'. Monsters will not be rendered unless
    in sight of the player.
Use "make rlg327" to compile executable dungeon.

Use "./rlg327" to generate a random dungeon.

Use "./rlg327 --save" to save dungeon to /home/"insert_username_here"/.rlg327/dungeon

Use "./rlg327 --load" to load dungeon from same location.

Use "./rlg327 --nummon x" to generate a dungeon with 'x' amount of monsters

Use "make clean" to delete the generated files.
