Assignment 1.04: Player Character and Monsters
Thomas Powell

This file will print a dungeon with monsters. I was unable to implement the
movement by turns and the monster movement. Each monster is represented by hexadecimal based off of  their characteristics.
For the time being the pc moves around erratically.

Use "make" to compile executable dungeon.

Use "./dungeon" to generate a random dungeon.

Use "./dungeon --save" to save dungeon to /home/"insert_username_here"/.rlg327/dungeon

Use "./dungeon --load" to load dungeon from same location.

Use "./dungeon -ls" to load and save the dungeon.

Use "./dungeon -lm x" to load a dungeon with 'x' amount of monsters

Use "./dungeon -nummon x" to generate a dungeon with 'x' amount of monsters

Use "make clean" to delete the executable dungeon file.
