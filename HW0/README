Assignment 0: Sobel Filter
Thomas Powell

This file will take a 1024x1024 ".pgm" file and use a sobel filter
on the image to outline the edges.

Set the sobel.c file to proper directory and then use "make" to
compile it. To convert the image, use "./sobel <your image name>.pgm"
which will convert your image with the filter and output as sobel.pgm. 

Use "make clean" in the command line in order to clean "sobel.pgm"
or files ending in ".edge.pgm".
