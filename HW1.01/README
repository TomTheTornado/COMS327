Assignment 1: Dungeon Generation
Thomas Powell

This file will create a random 80x21 dungeon. The border of this dungeon
however will not change and is displayed using '-' and '|' characters.
This dungeon will spawn a minimum of 6 rooms and a maximum of 10 rooms.
Rooms are all connected by corridors and the rooms do not overlap. 
1-2 upstairs and 1-2 downstairs will spawn in a random accessible locations 
in the dungeon.

Set the dungeon.c file in the proper directory and then use "make" to compile it.
To generate the dungeon use "./dungeon" which will generate the random dungeon.

Use "make clean" to delete the executable dungeon file.
